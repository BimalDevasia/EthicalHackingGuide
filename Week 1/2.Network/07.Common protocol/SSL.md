Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol developed by Netscape Communications Corporation to ensure the privacy and security of data transferred between a client and a server. It enables clients to authenticate the identity of servers, establishing a secure connection over the Internet or a private intranet. SSL uses a digital certificate on the server, allowing SSL-enabled browsers to communicate securely.

The SSL protocol involves a security handshake during the initiation of a secure connection. In this process, the client and server agree on security keys and encryption algorithms for the session. The client authenticates the server, and optionally, the server can request client authentication. After the handshake, SSL encrypts and decrypts all information exchanged between the client and the server, including URLs, form contents, access authorization details, and other data in both HTTPS requests and server responses.

HTTPS, a combination of SSL and HTTP, represents a unique protocol for secure communication. URLs linking to SSL-protected documents are specified with "https://" in HTML documents. Clients can open SSL-protected documents by explicitly using "https://" in the URL. Because HTTPS and HTTP use different protocols and ports (443 and 80, respectively), they can be run simultaneously. This allows websites to provide non-secure information to users while ensuring security for specific requests, such as filling out order forms or submitting sensitive data.

In the context of certificates, SSL relies on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which includes digital certificates, certificate authorities, registration authorities, a certificate management service, and X.500 directories. SSL session IDs are cached by IBMÂ® HTTP Server, enabling subsequent SSL session requests to use a shortened handshake during session establishment, enhancing efficiency and performance. Overall, SSL plays a crucial role in securing online communications and transactions, providing confidentiality and authentication in a digital environment.
